## About this fork

**Haskell Mooc** is an online course on Functional Programming that uses the
Haskell programming language. You can study at your own pace. All the
material and exercises are openly available.

The course is intended to be followed through the [Course
page](https://haskell.mooc.fi), using the [Original Github Repository](https://github.com/moocfi/haskell-mooc).

I'm not an owner or mantainer of the Haskell MOOC course. This is a fork made with the intent of storing notes and solutions from the course activities.
